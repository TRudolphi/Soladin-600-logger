# Soladin-600-logger

Project made in LUA, to read out 2 times a Mastervolt Soladin 600. Data is sent to Thingspeak.

The results can be watched on this website: trudolphi.nl/solar/

To make it all work:
To get started goto this website: https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=882

The program to flash your own LUA programs to the ESP8266 is: ESplorer.

If you use a Wemos, first the LUA operating system needs to be flashed!

How this is done can be read here: https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/flash/

You can make your own bin file with the wanted modules here: https://nodemcu-build.com

For the soladin project you can use the bin-file within the project.
